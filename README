This project contains scripts used for migrating Osmosis (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) source code from Subversion into a GIT repository.

The Subversion history is split across the following two repositories:
* http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/osmosis/
* https://www.bretth.com/repos/main/osmosis/

There are two separate approaches implemented in this project.

**** Fix SVN History Then Migrate (fix-svn-history) ****
To run the application perform the following steps:
* Open a command prompt in the fix-svn-history directory
* Compile the application
mvn clean package
* Run the application
java -jar target/osmosis-svn-to-git*.jar
* Kick back and wait a very long time (much faster if SVN is already mirrored, but still approx 30 minutes)
* Enjoy the GIT repository in data/target.git

**** Use GIT to Join History (git-join-history) ****
To run the application perform the following steps:
* Open a command prompt in the git-join-history directory
* Mirror the SVN repositories
./get_repositories.sh
* Run the GIT migration
./migrate_to_git.sh
* Kick back and wait a very long time (only takes minutes if SVN is already mirrored)
* Enjoy the GIT repository in data/target.git

Note that the above process generates a local replica of both the OSM (Open Street Map) and bretth.com/repos/main repositories.  The process can be sped up tremendously if you already have a local replica of these repositories by copying your replica(s) into the data sub-directory as osm-sync and bhmain-sync respectively.
